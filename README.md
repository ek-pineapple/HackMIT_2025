Hey team! This is our HackMIT project repo. Let's build something awesome together!

## Quick Setup

## How We Work Together

- **Always work on your own branch** (never push to main)
- **Commit often** with simple messages like "added login button" or "fixed bug"
- **Push your branch** and create a PR when ready
- **Ask for help** if you're stuck - we're a team!
